# Amelie, Python Wordsearch-Generator | Generador de Sopa de Letras escrito en Python

Amelie Wordsearch generator, aka sopa de letras in Spanish, generator written in Python. This is a little hack to the work of of SuperBiasedMan[0], that lets you output the wordsearch to A4 sized text pages ready to print and play.

This little hack lets you specify a set of words, that are the words are you gonna search, then the program randomly select them to create the wordsearch.

The name of the project is in honor to my Grandma, called Amelia. I created this for her, because she love to do "sopa de letras.

Feel free to use and improve it. Feedback is welcome!

The state of the project is: the code is ugly, but not *that* ugly, and works. You add the words, Amelie generates the wordsearch or sopa de letras, in txt ready to print and use!
