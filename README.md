# wordsearch-generator
Python Wordsearch, aka sopa de letras in Spanish, generator written in Python. Based on the core work of SuperBiasedMan[0].

This work was written for fun in a few minutes, because I wanted to create a wordsearch generator for my Grandma.

I added the feature that lets the user print the soups in A4 paper format. The code is ready for you to easily adapt it to iterate and print multiple-pages.

I added the following features :

- Print the words that you should search
- Creation of text files, ready to print in A4 paper, to print the soups
- Some minor fixes and features
