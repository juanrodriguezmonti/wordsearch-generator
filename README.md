# wordsearch-generator
Python Wordsearch, aka sopa de letras in Spanish, generator written in Python. This is a little hack to the work of of SuperBiasedMan[0], that lets you output the wordsearch to A4 sized text pages ready to print and play.

This little hack lets you specify a set of words, that are the words are you gonna search, then the program randomly select them to create the wordsearch.

Feel free to use and improve it. Feedback is welcome!
